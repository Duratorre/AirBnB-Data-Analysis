## 2. Motivation
This project aims at analysing AirBnB data in the cities of Seattle and Boston.
In particular, I will try to answer answering the following questions:

  1. Is there any time during the year when the price of a house increases or decreases? Are there any differences between the two cities?
  2. What are the characteristics of a house that influence the most its prize? Are there any differences between the two cities?
  3. How accurately can we predict house prices?

## 3. Data and File Descriptions
Data regarding rent properties in both cities have been provided by AirBnB:
- [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)
- [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)

The repository is organized as follows:
- the folders Boston and Seattle contain respectively AirBnB data for the
cities of Boston and Seattle;
- inside each folder, the file calendar.csv contains AirBnB data related to
house prices in time, listings.csv contains data regarding all the properties'
characteristics, whereas reviews.csv contains all the reviews for the said houses;
- the file Analysis.ipynb contains all the calculations and analysis done.
